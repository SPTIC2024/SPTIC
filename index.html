                Good education is passport for a bright future but quality education is the foundation of a progressive and successful community.
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally, St. Paul Technological Institute of Cavite, Inc. was incorporated in the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 3, 2014 to provide technical and vocational education. However, on December 2014, the Articles of Incorporation was amended for the school to focus on basic education program. On January 13, 2015, the school was recognized by the Department of Education to offer Basic Education Program. The school was also granted the temporary order to accept foreign students for all programs before the end of 2015 by the Bureau of Immigration. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Located at Brgy. Langkaan I, along the Governor’s Drive, St. Paul Technological Institute of Cavite, Inc. is a fast growing academic institution in the bustling City of Dasmarinas. On the first school year of its operation (SY 2015-2016), the school has a total of 253 students from Pre-Elementary, Elementary, and Secondary levels. The following school year, the enrolees significantly increased despite of the prevailing economic situation of the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea of putting up a school is a brainchild of Engr. Nelson Q. Remulla, the major founder of this institution. He is in the business of construction and technical consultancy in the City of Dasmarinas for quite a long time. Seeing the need of the community for an institution that will play a vital role in its development and a haven for knowledge producers that will engineer the future of the province and of the country, he started to conceptualize a learning institution in 2009.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0">
              <p>
 Being a visionary leader and a philanthropist, he envisioned to help the community to produce highly experienced, skilled, and qualified professionals through right and proper education. For him, individuals who are properly trained are urgently needed by this country to address the demands of business and industries. He believes that by integrating moral values with technology and academics, the school will be able to produce students of high calibre.
              </p>
              <p>
                The school was named after St. Paul the Apostle, one of the most important and influential among all saints in the Roman Catholicism who was considered as the patron of theologians, missions, writers, evangelists, journalists, authors, public workers, rope and saddle makers, tent makers, and the Gentile Christians. Originally, his name was Saul. He is a Roman citizen and a Pharisee who was active in the persecution of early Christians. He also oversee the martyrdom of St. Stephen. But on his way to Damascus, Syria, he experienced a great vision and a spiritual awakening that eventually led to his baptism. He travelled the ancient Christian world to preach about Christianity and established many churches that earned him many critics that eventually led to his imprisonment and later, beheading under the hands of Emperor Nero in 67 CE in Rome. His writings and letters to the early Christian churches served as guide to proper Christian living.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                While the school was named after St. Paul, the school remains a non-sectarian school serving all students regardless of their religious affiliation. Following the examples of Apostle Paul, the school embraces the honorable duty of serving the Creator for the greater glory by empowering the people through education and bringing the benefits of quality education to the world.
